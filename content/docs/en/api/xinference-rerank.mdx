title: Xinference Rerank Format
---

{/* TODO: Convert to Callout - warning: Important Note */}
In New API, Xinference's rerank response structure will be formatted as Jina's rerank response structure, with the same usage as Jina's rerank. **For Dify and other client users**: When configuring, please select **Jina AI** as the provider type, not Xinference, and use the model names supported by Xinference.

## 📝 Introduction

Xinference's rerank API is fully compatible with Jina AI's rerank API. Please refer to the [Jina AI Rerank Format](jinaai-rerank.md) documentation for detailed usage methods, request parameters, and response formats.

## 💡 Usage

When using Xinference rerank API, simply set the `model` parameter to a rerank model supported by Xinference. All other parameters and usage methods are the same as Jina AI's rerank API.

### Example Request

```bash
curl https://your-newapi-server-address/v1/rerank \
