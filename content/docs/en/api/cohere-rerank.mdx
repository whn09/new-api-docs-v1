## 📝 Introduction

Given a query and a list of texts, the Rerank API will sort the texts based on their relevance to the query. Each text is assigned a relevance score, resulting in an ordered array of results. This feature is especially useful for search and retrieval applications, optimizing document ranking and helping users find relevant information faster.

## 💡 Request Examples

### Basic Rerank Request ✅

```bash
curl https://your-newapi-server-address/v1/rerank \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEWAPI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "rerank-v3.5",
    "query": "What is the capital of the United States?",
    "documents": [
      "The capital of Nevada is Carson City.",
      "The Northern Mariana Islands are a group of islands in the Pacific, with Saipan as the capital.",
      "Washington, D.C. (also known as Washington or D.C., officially the District of Columbia) is the capital of the United States.",
      "Capitalization in English grammar is the use of uppercase letters at the beginning of words. English usage differs from other languages in capitalization.",
      "The death penalty existed in the United States before it became a country. As of 2017, 30 out of 50 states have the death penalty legalized."
    ],
    "top_n": 3
  }'
```

**Response Example:**

```json

    ],
    "max_tokens_per_doc": 512
  }'
```

**Response Example:**

## 🌟 Best Practices

### Document Preparation Tips

1. **Document Length**: Keep each document concise and clear, avoid being too long. Long documents will be automatically truncated.
2. **Structured Data**: Format structured data as YAML strings for best performance. For example:

   ```yaml
   title: Product Name
   price: 9999 yuan
   features:
     - Feature 1
     - Feature 2
   ```

3. **Number of Documents**: Do not exceed 1,000 documents per request for best performance.

### Query Optimization

1. **Be Specific**: Formulate clear and specific queries for more accurate ranking results.

2. **Avoid Vague Queries**: Avoid overly vague or generic queries, as this may result in less distinct relevance scores.

### Understanding Relevance Scores

Relevance scores are normalized to the range [0, 1]:

- Scores close to 1 indicate high relevance to the query
- Scores close to 0 indicate low relevance
