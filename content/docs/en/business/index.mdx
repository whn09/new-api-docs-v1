## 💡 Our Original Intention

The original intention behind New API's creation is simple: **to enable more people to use AI and lower the barrier to AI adoption.**

We believe that AI should not be a privilege for a few, but a tool accessible to everyone. Whether you are an independent developer, a startup team, or a large enterprise, you should be able to access world-leading large model capabilities at a reasonable cost.

## 🤝 About Commercialization

We chose commercialization not to maximize profit, but to ensure the project can **develop healthily and sustainably.**

Servers incur costs, maintenance requires effort, and ecosystem development needs resources – moderate commercialization is a necessary guarantee for New API to continue serving the community. We pledge to invest our earnings into product iteration, community building, and ecosystem expansion, ensuring that every bit of support translates into better services.

## 📜 Gentleman's Agreement

The New API community has always upheld the concept of a **Gentleman's Agreement**:

- We trust every user and provide flexible and open ways of use.
- We do not impose cumbersome restrictions, trusting that everyone will use resources responsibly.
- We expect users, while benefiting, to also respect the sustainable development of the project.
- If your project benefits from New API, we welcome contributions back to the community in any form.

This is an agreement based on trust and respect, and a continuation of the open-source spirit.
