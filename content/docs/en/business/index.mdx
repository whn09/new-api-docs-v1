## 💡 Our Mission

The original intention behind New API is simple: **to make AI accessible to more people and lower the barrier to AI adoption**.

We believe that AI should not be a privilege for the few, but a tool within everyone's reach. Whether you're an independent developer, a startup team, or a large enterprise, you should be able to access the world's leading large model capabilities at a reasonable cost.

## 🤝 About Commercialization

We chose to commercialize not to maximize profits, but to ensure the **healthy and sustainable development** of the project.

Servers require funding, maintenance requires effort, and ecosystem building requires resources. Moderate commercialization is essential to keep New API serving the community continuously. We commit to investing our revenue in product iteration, community building, and ecosystem expansion, ensuring that every bit of support translates into better service.

## 📜 Gentleman's Agreement

The New API community has always upheld the philosophy of a **Gentleman's Agreement**:

- We trust every user and provide flexible, open usage methods
- We don't impose cumbersome restrictions, trusting that everyone will use resources responsibly
- We hope that while users benefit, they will also respect the project's sustainable development
- If your project benefits from New API, we welcome contributions back to the community in any form

This is a commitment based on trust and respect, and a continuation of the open-source spirit.
