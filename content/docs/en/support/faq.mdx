## 💰 Quota Related Questions

{/* TODO: Collapsible tip: What is quota? How is it calculated? */}

    The quota calculation formula is as follows:

    Quota = Group Multiplier * Model Multiplier * (Prompt Token Count + Completion Token Count * Completion Multiplier)

    Completion Multiplier explanation:

    - GPT3.5: Fixed at 1.33
    - GPT4: Fixed at 2 (same as official)

    Notes:

    - In non-streaming mode, the official API returns the total tokens consumed, but the multipliers for prompt and completion are different
    - New API's default multipliers are consistent with the official ones and have been adjusted accordingly

{/* TODO: Collapsible tip: Why does it say 'insufficient quota' even though my account has enough? */}

    This is because token quota and account quota are separate:

    - Token quota is only used to set the maximum usage limit
    - Users can freely set token quota
    - Please check if your token quota is sufficient

## 🔧 Channel Configuration Questions

{/* TODO: Collapsible tip: What are weight and priority in channels? */}

    Weight and priority are two important parameters that control the usage order and distribution of channels:

    - Priority: The higher the number, the higher the priority. Channels with higher priority are used first
    - Weight: Among channels with the same priority, requests are distributed according to the weight ratio

    For example:

    - A channel with priority 2 will be used before a channel with priority 1
    - Two channels with priority 1 and a weight ratio of 2:1 will receive requests in a 2:1 ratio

{/* TODO: Collapsible tip: Prompt says no available channel? */}

    Please check the following settings:

    1. User group settings
    2. Channel group settings
    3. Model settings for the channel

{/* TODO: Collapsible tip: Channel test error: invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value */}

    This error means the return value is not valid JSON, but an HTML page.

    The most likely reason: Your deployment server's IP or proxy node has been blocked by CloudFlare.

{/* TODO: Collapsible tip: Channel test error: Multiplier or price not configured, please ask the admin to set it */}

    Please check if the multiplier or price is configured in 'System Settings - Operation Settings - Model Multiplier Settings'.

    Or enable 'Self-use Mode' in 'System Settings - Operation Settings'.

## 🌐 Deployment & Connection Issues

{/* TODO: Collapsible tip: ChatGPT Next Web error: Failed to fetch */}

    Please check the following:

    1. Do not set BASE_URL during deployment
    2. Make sure the API endpoint and API Key are correct
    3. Check if HTTPS is enabled (browsers block HTTP requests under HTTPS domains)

{/* TODO: Collapsible tip: Error: Current group load is saturated, please try again later */}

    This means the upstream channel returned a 429 error (too many requests).

## 📦 Database & Upgrade Issues

{/* TODO: Collapsible tip: Will my data be lost after upgrading? */}

    It depends on the database type:

    - MySQL: Data will not be lost
    - SQLite: You need to mount the volume for the one-api.db database file as per the deployment command, otherwise data will be lost after container restart

{/* TODO: Collapsible tip: Do I need to change the database before upgrading? */}

    Generally, no. The system will automatically adjust during initialization.

    If special handling is needed, it will be explained in the release notes with corresponding scripts provided.

{/* TODO: Collapsible tip: Error after manually modifying the database: Database consistency has been broken, please contact the admin? */}

    This error means an invalid channel ID record was detected in the ability table. Common reasons:

    - When deleting records from the channel table, the corresponding invalid channels in the ability table were not cleaned up
    - Each model supported by a channel must have a corresponding record in the ability table
