## 💰 Quota-Related Issues

<Callout type="info" title="What is quota? How is it calculated?" collapsible>
  The quota calculation formula is as follows:
</Callout>

    Quota = Group Ratio * Model Ratio * (Prompt Token Count + Completion Token Count * Completion Ratio)

    Completion Ratio Explanation:

    - GPT3.5: Fixed at 1.33

    - GPT4: Fixed at 2 (consistent with official)

    Notes:

    - In non-streaming mode, the official API returns the total tokens consumed, but the consumption ratios for prompt and completion are different.

    - The default ratio of New API is consistent with the official ratio and has been adjusted.

<Callout type="info" title="Why does it prompt insufficient quota when the account quota is sufficient?" collapsible>
  This is because token quota and account quota are separate:
</Callout>

    - Token quota is only used to set the maximum usage limit.
    - Users can freely set the token quota.
    - Please check if your token quota is sufficient.

## 🔧 Channel Configuration Issues

<Callout type="info" title="What are Weight and Priority in Channels?" collapsible>
  Weight and Priority are two important parameters that control the order and distribution of channel usage:
</Callout>

    - Priority: A larger number indicates higher priority; channels with higher priority will be used first.

    - Weight: Among channels with the same priority, requests are distributed according to the weight ratio.

    For example:

    - Channels with priority 2 will be used before channels with priority 1.

    - For two channels with the same priority 1, if the weight ratio is 2:1, requests will be distributed in a 2:1 ratio.

<Callout type="info" title="Prompt: No available channels?" collapsible>
  Please check the following settings:
</Callout>

    1. User Group Settings
    2. Channel Group Settings
    3. Channel Model Settings

<Callout
  type="info"
  title="Channel test error: invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value"
  collapsible
>
  This error indicates that the return value is not valid JSON, but an HTML page.
</Callout>

    The most likely reason is: Your deployment site's IP or proxy node has been blocked by CloudFlare.

<Callout
  type="info"
  title="Channel test error: Ratio or price not configured, please contact the administrator to set it."
  collapsible
>
  Please check if the ratio or price has been configured in 'System Settings - Operation Settings - Model Ratio Settings'.
</Callout>

    Or enable 'Self-use Mode' in 'System Settings - Operation Settings'.

## 🌐 Deployment and Connection Issues

<Callout type="info" title="ChatGPT Next Web error: Failed to fetch" collapsible>
  Please check the following:
</Callout>

    1. Do not set BASE_URL during deployment.
    2. Confirm that the API address and API Key are filled in correctly.
    3. Check if HTTPS is enabled (browsers will block HTTP requests under HTTPS domains).

<Callout type="info" title="Error: Current group load is saturated, please try again later." collapsible>
  This indicates that an upstream channel encountered a 429 error (Too Many Requests).
</Callout>

## 📦 Database and Upgrade Issues

<Callout type="info" title="Will my data be lost after upgrading?" collapsible>
  It varies depending on the database type:
</Callout>

    - MySQL: Data will not be lost.
    - SQLite: You need to mount a volume according to the deployment command to persist the one-api.db database file, otherwise data will be lost after the container restarts.

<Callout type="info" title="Does the database need to be changed before upgrading?" collapsible>
  Generally, no. The system will automatically adjust during initialization.
</Callout>

    If special handling is required, it will be explained in the update log and corresponding scripts will be provided.

<Callout
  type="info"
  title="Error after manually modifying the database: Database consistency has been corrupted, please contact the administrator?"
  collapsible
>
  This error indicates that invalid channel ID records were detected in the 'ability' table. Common reasons:
</Callout>

    - Invalid channels in the 'ability' table were not cleaned up synchronously when deleting 'channel' table records.
    - Each model supported by a channel needs to have a corresponding record in the 'ability' table.
