2.  The first time you enter, you will be prompted to install the Docker service. Click **Install Now**.
3.  Follow the prompts to complete the Docker service installation.

## Install New API

### Method One: Using Baota App Store (Recommended)

1.  In the Baota Panel Docker feature, click **App Store**.
2.  Search for and find **New-API**.
3.  Click **Install**.
4.  Configure the following basic options:
    -   Container Name: Customizable, defaults to `new-api`
    -   Port Mapping: Defaults to `3000:3000`
    -   Environment Variables: Add as needed (e.g., TZ=Asia/Shanghai)
    -   Directory Mapping: Ensure the `/data` directory is mapped to a host directory.
5.  Click **Submit** to complete the installation.

### Method Two: Using a Custom Image

> It is strongly recommended to install via the "App Store" for automatic configuration. This section is for advanced users who have a clear understanding of Docker and Baota container configuration.

<Callout type="warn" title="I confirm that I want to manually set up the image and will resolve any issues myself." collapsible>
  Only refer to the following steps to manually configure a custom image after you have checked and agreed to the above confirmation:
</Callout>

    1. In the Baota Panel Docker feature, click **Image Management**.
    2. Click **Get Image** -> **Pull Image**.
    3. Enter Image Name: `calciumion/new-api:latest`
    4. Click **Submit** and wait for the image pull to complete.
    5. After the pull is complete, go to **Container List** and click **Create Container**.
    6. Fill in the following information:
       - Container Name: `new-api` (customizable)
       - Image: Select the `calciumion/new-api:latest` image you just pulled.
       - Port Mapping: Add `3000:3000`
       - Directory Mapping: Add `/your/host/path:/data` (replace with your host path)
       - Environment Variables: Add as needed (e.g., TZ=Asia/Shanghai)
    7. Click **Submit** to complete the installation.

## Configuration and Access

After installation, you can access New API at the following address:

    http://服务器IP:3000

The first visit will automatically guide you to the initialization page. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up an administrator account and password (only required for the first installation), then log in using the administrator account you set.

## Common Issues

### 1. Unable to access New API interface

-   Check if port mapping is correct.
-   Confirm if the server firewall allows port 3000.
-   Check if the container is running normally.

### 2. Data cannot be persisted

-   Confirm if the `/data` directory is correctly mapped.
-   Check if host directory permissions are correct.
