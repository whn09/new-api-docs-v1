title: Docker Compose Deployment
---

This document provides detailed steps for deploying New API using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Recommended OS: Linux (Ubuntu/CentOS/Debian, etc.)

## Deploy with Docker Compose

### Method One: Clone the Project with Git (Recommended)

If you have normal access to GitHub, this method is recommended. The project already includes a complete `docker-compose.yml` configuration file:

```shell
# Download project source code
git clone https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api.git

# Enter project directory
cd new-api

# Edit docker-compose.yml file as needed
# Use nano editor
nano docker-compose.yml
# Or use vim editor
# vim docker-compose.yml
```

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
  The `docker-compose.yml` file included with the project has already configured all necessary services (including MySQL and
  Redis). You only need to modify parameters such as ports and passwords according to your actual situation to use it.
</Callout>

### Method Two: Manually Create Configuration File

If you cannot access GitHub or clone the repository, you can manually create the configuration file:

1. Create a directory for New API deployment:

```shell
mkdir new-api
cd new-api
```

2. Create the `docker-compose.yml` file in this directory

   You can refer to the configuration examples in the [Docker Compose Configuration Guide](docker-compose-yml.md) document and choose according to your needs:
   - For production environments, a complete configuration (including MySQL and Redis) is recommended.
   - For testing environments, a simplified configuration can be used.

3. Use a text editor to create the file:

```shell
# Use nano editor
nano docker-compose.yml

# Or use vim editor
vim docker-compose.yml
```

Copy the selected configuration content into this file and customize it as needed.

## Start Services

Once the configuration file is ready, whether you cloned it with Git or created it manually, you can use the following command to start the services:

```shell
# Start services using Docker Compose
docker compose up -d
```

This command will automatically pull the required images and start the services in the background.

## View Logs

- **Real-time logs for all services**

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

- **Logs for a specific service** (Examples: `new-api`, `mysql`, `redis`)

```bash
docker compose logs -f new-api
docker compose logs -f mysql
docker compose logs -f redis
```

- **View only the last N lines**

```bash
docker compose logs --tail=100 new-api
```

- **View logs from a recent period**

```bash
docker compose logs --since=10m new-api
```

- **Show timestamps**

```bash
docker compose logs -f -t new-api
```

- **Foreground mode debugging (real-time log output with startup)**

```bash
docker compose up
# Or only start and follow a specific service
docker compose up new-api
```

Press Ctrl+C to exit foreground mode (this will stop the corresponding service). For background operation, use `-d`.

- **View service list/status**

```bash
docker compose ps
```

- **View logs using container name** (when `container_name` is set, e.g., `new-api` in the configuration)

```bash
docker logs -f new-api
```

## Stop Services

```shell
# Stop services
docker compose down
```

## Access the System

After the services start successfully, accessing `http://Server_IP:3000` will automatically redirect to the initialization page. Follow the on-screen instructions to manually set up the administrator account and password (only required for the first installation). After initialization, you can log in to the system using the administrator account you set.
