2. Run the installation script to install BT Panel
3. After installation, use the provided address, username, and password to log in to the BT Panel

## Installing Docker

1. After logging into the BT Panel, find and click **Docker** in the left sidebar menu
2. The first time you enter, you will be prompted to install the Docker service. Click **Install Now**
3. Follow the prompts to complete the installation of the Docker service

## Installing New API

### Method One: Using the BT App Store (Recommended)

1. In the BT Panel Docker feature, click **App Store**
2. Search for and find **New-API**
3. Click **Install**
4. Configure the following basic options:
   - Container Name: Customizable, default is `new-api`
   - Port Mapping: Default is `3000:3000`
   - Environment Variables: Add as needed (e.g., TZ=Asia/Shanghai, etc.)
   - Directory Mapping: Ensure that the `/data` directory is mapped to a host directory
5. Click **Submit** to complete the installation

### Method Two: Using a Custom Image

> It is highly recommended to install via the "App Store" for automatic configuration. This section is for advanced usage and is suitable for users who clearly understand Docker and BT container configuration.

{/* TODO: Collapsible warning: I confirm that I want to manually set up the image and will resolve any issues myself */}
Only after you check and agree to the above confirmation should you refer to the following steps to manually configure the custom image:

    1. In the BT Panel Docker feature, click **Image Management**
    2. Click **Get Image** -> **Pull Image**
    3. Enter the image name: `calciumion/new-api:latest`
    4. Click **Submit** and wait for the image pull to complete
    5. After the pull is complete, go to the **Container List** and click **Create Container**
    6. Fill in the following information:
       - Container Name: `new-api` (Customizable)
       - Image: Select the recently pulled `calciumion/new-api:latest`
       - Port Mapping: Add `3000:3000`
       - Directory Mapping: Add `/your/host/path:/data` (Replace with your host path)
       - Environment Variables: Add as needed (e.g., TZ=Asia/Shanghai, etc.)
    7. Click **Submit** to complete the installation

## Configuration and Access

After installation, you can access New API using the following address:

    http://Server IP:3000

The first visit will automatically guide you to the initialization page. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the administrator account and password (required only for the first installation), and then log in using the set administrator account.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Unable to access the New API interface

- Check if the port mapping is correct
- Confirm whether the server firewall allows access to port 3000
- Check if the container is running normally

### 2. Data cannot be persisted

- Confirm whether the `/data` directory is mapped correctly
- Check if the host directory permissions are correct
