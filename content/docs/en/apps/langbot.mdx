## Integrating NewAPI

LangBot supports integrating with locally deployed NewAPI and third-party NewAPI services built using NewAPI.

### Usage

1.  Obtain an API key from NewAPI

        If NewAPI is deployed locally, please configure the API address yourself (refer to [Container Network Connection](https://docs.langbot.app/en/workshop/network-details.html)). If using a third-party NewAPI service, you can copy the address from the page. Note that `/v1` needs to be appended to the address.

2.  Add a model in LangBot, select NewAPI as the provider, and fill in the corresponding API key and API address
