### Usage Instructions

1.  Get API key from NewAPI

        For locally deployed NewAPI, please configure the API address yourself (refer to [Container Network Connection](https://docs.langbot.app/en/workshop/network-details.html)). If using third-party NewAPI services, you can copy the address from the page. Note that `/v1` needs to be added after the address.

2.  Add a model in LangBot, select NewAPI as the provider, and fill in the corresponding API key and API address
