#### 5. Windows Common Issues Troubleshooting

{/* TODO: Collapsible example: Error message */}permission denied" during installation"
This is usually a permission issue. Try the following solutions:

    - Run `PowerShell` as administrator

    - Or configure `npm` to use the user directory: `npm config set prefix %APPDATA%\npm`

{/* TODO: Collapsible example: PowerShell Execution Policy Error */}
If you encounter execution policy restrictions, run:
`     Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    `
